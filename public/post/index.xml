      <description>I learned how to make scatter plots the other day utilizing the ggplot2 tool. I initially had some issues but quickly remedied the situation. A missing library was one of them, namely being miniUI. In short, it&amp;rsquo;s an interesting field so far and I may pursue further education in this field.</description>

      <description>Time series plots are interesting data visualizations where you can match values over a period fo time.
Step 1: Implement all PackagesInstall all the required packages such as lahman, sqldf, and ggplot2
library(Lahman)## Warning: package &amp;#39;Lahman&amp;#39; was built under R version 3.4.3library(sqldf)## Warning: package &amp;#39;sqldf&amp;#39; was built under R version 3.4.3## Loading required package: gsubfn## Loading required package: proto## Loading required package: RSQLitelibrary(ggplot2)## Warning: package &amp;#39;ggplot2&amp;#39; was built under R version 3.</description>
