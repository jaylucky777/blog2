Time series plots are interesting data visualizations where you can match values over a period fo time.

## Step 1: Implement all Packages

Install all the required packages such as lahman, sqldf, and ggplot2

```{r}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)
```


## Step 2: Extract the Data

in the lahman library we pull the playerID of Babe Ruth from the Batting table.

```{r}
query<-"SELECT yearID,HR
FROM Batting 
WHERE playerID='ruthba01'"

result<-sqldf(query)

```


## Step 3: Visualize the Data

This is where it gets interesting.  We will now build the time series plot with the extracted data.

```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR),color="red")+
  geom_line(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR),color="blue")+
  ggtitle("Year and Homeruns of Babe Ruth")+
  xlab("year")+
  ylab("Homeruns")


```
